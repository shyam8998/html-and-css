    <h1>IMAGES</h1>
    <P>Image theory focuses on an individual making a decision in the context of a relationship or organization with a presumption that the decision may remain or may later be changed. Image theory was proposed as an alternative to traditional decision-making theory and as a descriptive psychological theory of decision making (Mitchell & Beach, 1990).
      <br>

Images can be defined as information structures representing different kinds of information about what the decision maker is doing, how and why he or she is doing it, and what kind of progress is being made (Beach & Mitchell, 1987). </P>

 <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>Images may be two-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by optical devices â€“ such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or water.
<br>
The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a map, a graph, a pie chart, a painting or a banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or computer graphics technology, or developed by a combination of methods, especially in a pseudo-photograph.
<br>
A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode ray tube. A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile by photography or any other digital process.
<br>
A mental image exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a graph, function, or imaginary entity. For example, Sigmund Freud claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.[citation needed]
<br>
The development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of sound art have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis. There are Two Types of Images a. Still Image b. Moving Image</p>
