        <h1>The 10 most expensive cars in the world</h1>
    <p>In life, you get what you pay for. And for some very wealthy gearheads, forking over the big bucks means getting ludicrous amounts of speed, industry-leading technology and a whole lot of prestige. Hit the track in any one of these supercars and you’ll quickly understand why these vehicles cost as much as they do.</p>

    <h3>Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita — $4.8M</h3>
    <p>
        When it comes to ultra-rare vehicles, the Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita stands above the rest. The Swedish boutique manufacturer only built two of these things, and one of them happens to be owned by boxer Floyd “Money” Mayweather, who made headlines in August 2015 by announcing he paid $4.8M for the privilege. The company describes the hypercar as a “diamond on wheels.” It’s not just hyperbole, either; the CCXR Trevita’s specially designed and coated carbon fibre body actually sparkles a silvery white under sunlight. The company originally planned to produce three copies of this car, but the process for manufacturing the white carbon fibre proved to be so difficult that the decision was made to limit production to just two.

The Trevita, which is a Swedish abbreviation meaning “three whites,” features a double carbon rear wing and a 4.8-litre V8 under the hood, pumping out 1,018 horsepower and 796 lb.-ft. of torque. It can hit 100 km/h from a standstill in a scant 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of over 410 km/h. Impressive, indeed</p>

    <h3>Lamborghini Veneno Roadster — $4.5M</h3>
    <p>
        The convertible version of Lamborghini’s fierce-looking supercar is the most expensive — and exclusive — vehicle in Lambo’s arsenal. Only nine Veneno Roadsters were produced, beginning in 2014. Those lucky to get their hands on one of these exclusive cars surely forgot about the hefty price tag as soon as the 740-horsepower V12 engine hit its top speed of 355 km/h.

    <h3>Lykan HyperSport — $3.4M</h3>
    <p>The brainchild of Dubai-based W Motors, the Lykan is the first supercar made by a company located in the Middle East. It was featured in the film Furious 7 and has already built up its supercar cachet as one of the most expensive and limited production cars ever — W Motors plan to produce only seven units of the car. So, what makes the Lykan so special? Well, in addition to being powered by a 3.7-litre twin-turbocharged flat-six engine that produces 780 horsepower and 708 lb.-ft. of torque, the two-door, rear-wheel-drive supercar can accelerate from zero to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds, and it’s the first car to feature headlights with embedded jewels (buyers have a choice of diamonds, rubies or sapphires). Talk about extravagant.</p>

    <h3>Koenigsegg One:1 — $2.85M</h3>
    <p>The One:1 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 5.0-litre V8, producing a seriously absurd 1,340 horsepower and 740 lb.-ft. of torque. And how to explain the odd name? The One:1’s extensive use of carbon fibre lends a curb weight of just 1,340 kilograms, which matches the horsepower output. All of this translates to blistering performance on the track. The supercar can reach 300 km/h from a standstill in just 11.922 seconds.

    <h3>Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse — $2.6M</h3>
    <p>The former holder of the “fastest car in the world” title, the Bugatti Veyron may be discontinued, but it remains among the most coveted status symbols in the automotive world. The Grand Sport Vitesse convertible is loaded with a neck-breaking 1,200 horsepower and 1,106 lb.-ft. of torque. Compare that with the standard Bugatti Veyron‘s 987 horses and 922 lb.-ft. of torque, and the difference becomes pretty evident.</p>

    <h3>Ferrari F60 America — $2.5M</h3>
    <p>Ferrari decided to commemorate 60 years in North America with this rear-wheel-driven, V12-powered, 730-horsepower supercar, and is it ever a rare beauty. Based on the F12 Berlinetta, only 10 F60 Americas were slated to be produced when it was announced in October 2014, and, not surprisingly, all 10 copies found deep-pocketed buyers very quickly. The F60 America differentiates itself from the F12 Berlinetta with bolder styling, an open roof and a gussied-up red interior.

    <h3>Aston Martin One-77 — $1.6M</h3>
    <p>Arguably one of the most beautiful cars of all time, only 77 copies of the supercar were ever built (hence the name). The award-winning One-77 features a naturally aspirated 7.3-litre V12 engine that produces 750 horsepower. The top speed is estimated to be around 320 km/h and it’s capable of going from zero to 100 km/h in about 3.5 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Ferrari LaFerrari — $1.6M</h3>
    <p>Ferrari‘s first hybrid supercar comes packed with track-tested technology. The La Ferrari is capable of a combined 950 horsepower, when taking into account its 6.3-litre, V12 engine that produces 789 horsepower and a 161-horsepower electric motor; all of this amounts to a 40 per cent decrease in fuel consumption. Ferrari says the car has a top speed exceeding 350 km/h, reaching 100 km/h in less than three seconds.</p>

    <h3>McLaren P1 — $1.35M</h3>
    <p>The McLaren P1 is the epitome of hybrid insanity. Powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre V8 engine paired to an electric motor, the P1 pumps out a whopping 903 horsepower. After debuting as a concept at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, the first P1 hit the road in September 2013. Since then, a total of 375 McLaren P1s have been produced, with the last rolling off the assembly line in December 2015. When it comes to sheer hybridized power, the P1 may very well stand in a class all its own for a while to come.</p>

    <h3>Pagani Huayra — $1.3M</h3>
    <p>Named after Huayra-tata, a god of the winds that was worshipped by the Inca people, the Pagani Huayra certainly does fit the bill with its wind-swept body. The Italian supercar is propelled by a twin-turbo Mercedes-AMG V12, six-litre engine which produces 730 horsepower and 740 lb.-ft. of torque. It has a top speed of 372 km/h and can accelerate from rest to 100 km/h in only 3.3 seconds.</p>
