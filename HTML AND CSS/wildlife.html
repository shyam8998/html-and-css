    <h3> A Photograph by STEFANO UNTERTHINER</h3>
    <p>Growing up in a small mountain village in northwest Italy, Stefano Unterthiner spent his early years photographing and trekking around the beautiful mountains of the Aosta Valley region.

    <h3>A Photograph by ANNETTE BONNIER</h3>
    <p>“From an early age growing up in Miami, I was captivated by the worlds depicted in Life, Look and National Geographic. Photos mesmerized me, people fascinated me and injustice infuriated me. I found an outlet for my passion for Documentary Photography at the University of Florida where I graduated in 1979. I continued my studies under eminent photographers like Mary Ellen Marks, David Allen Harvey, and Steve McCurry.

Photography has transported me to places I would never have imagined – inside a housing project with a crack addict and her 7 children, in a propeller plane with ‘Brothers to the Rescue’ searching for dying refugees, assessing the damage to homes after Hurricane Andrew, backstage with the artistic characters at Cirque du Soleil, and meeting some of the transformed men in Sing Sing Prison.

Traveling and working with NGO’s in India and Southeast Asia transformed me in many ways. The people, their survival under such harsh conditions and their amazing perseverance is inspiring. The beauty, spirituality, and colors of the Eastern world draw me back again and again. My work has been published in the New York Times, Tropic Magazine (Miami Herald), and Loft Magazine. I also have participated in various gallery shows around the country.”</p>

    <h3>A Photograph by KAREN LUNNEY</h3>
    <p>Karen Lunney is a contemporary photographic artist working out of Brisbane and North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia. Her work investigates states of transition,liminal space, a place of possibility, where one thing has ceased and another not yet started. The light of dawn and dusk, the ocean-land interface and the migration of animals all represent forms of liminality. The cultural transitions of peoples forced to westernise, not sure what culture to save into their new modernity and the climatic changes causing paroxysms around the globe both produce uncertainties for the future with consequences for many.</p>
